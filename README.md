# mcmodbrowser

An alternate search interface for [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) that lets you filter Minecraft mods by game version properly. Unlike the official interface, it sorts mods according to when they received updates for your selected game version specifically.

Available **[here](https://mcmodbrowser.github.io)**.
